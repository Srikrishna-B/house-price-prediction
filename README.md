# Prediction of house prices using supervised learning

We shall use the concept of **linear regression** in supervised learning to predict house prices using different attributes.
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

# Observations
In the attributes in which there is a pattern, there seems to be a best fit line but the tests give significant errors. This is because we have used **linear regression** model to predict the value of <code>price</code>, which is not very accurate.
